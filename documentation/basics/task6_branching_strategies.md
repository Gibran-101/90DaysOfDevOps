## 🧠 Task 6: Why Branching Strategies Matter

### 📌 Overview

Branching strategies are crucial in collaborative software development. They enable structure, reduce chaos, and make it possible for multiple people to work on the same codebase without constantly stepping on each other’s toes.

### 🔍 Key Benefits

1. **🧪 Isolating Features and Bug Fixes**  
   Separate branches ensure that new features or bug fixes don’t interfere with the stable version of your application.

2. **🚀 Parallel Development**  
   Teams can work simultaneously on different features. One dev works on a login system, another on performance optimization — no interference.

3. **🛡️ Reducing Merge Conflicts**  
   Isolated changes mean fewer conflicts. And when they do happen (as I simulated), they’re easier to manage and trace.

4. **🔍 Better Code Reviews**  
   With branches, each change can be reviewed independently via Pull Requests. This ensures that every piece of code is tested, reviewed, and approved before hitting `main`.
